        <h2>2019 Top 5 Fantasy Quarterbacks</h2>
<hr>    
    <p>The most important player on the field in a real-time football game is often one of the least important positions in Daily Fantasy Sports. Yes, I know that sounds counter-intuitive but itâ€™s the truth. On any given slate of games, there are normally a half dozen or more fantastic options with plenty of upside due to the price that the Daily Fantasy Football (DFS) sites have given them. While big-name quarterbacks are often the highest owned players at the position, we often can find a similar scoring floor and ceiling (more on this later) with a less popular name.</p>
